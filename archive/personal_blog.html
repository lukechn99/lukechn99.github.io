                Bioenergy
            </h2>
            <p>Luke Chen, May 3, 2019</p><br>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">
                Bioenergy is the past, and it seems like we are moving towards making it 
                the future as well. Wood was one of the first sources of bioenergy used. 
                It was burned to provide light, warmth, and for cooking foods. 
                In successive eras, oil, coal, and natural gas have largely taken the 
                place of wood in providing energy for developed countries. 
                However, taking sequestered carbon in coal, oil, and natural gas, 
                and releasing it into the atmosphere as byproduct greenhouse gas 
                emissions in the process of creating energy has caused severe climate 
                change that will be hard to recover from. Bioenergy claims to address 
                this problem by only releasing the recently sequestered carbon 
                (like in tree wood) instead of putting carbon from below ground into 
                the atmosphere. However, even using trees has a short term negative 
                effect on the atmosphere because it simultaneously puts carbon into the 
                atmosphere while also taking away the very source of carbon uptake that 
                would balance the extra carbon: trees! In addition to this dilemma, 
                there is also the fact that cutting down forests for energy is impractical 
                because wood has a lower EROI (energy return on investment) than energy-rich 
                sources like oil. Luckily, wood is not the only bioresource that we have 
                injected into our energy systems. Another source of bioenergy that we use 
                comes from biomass waste. Deriving energy from biomass waste is more 
                practical than doing so from wood because people produce 262 million 
                tons of municipal solid waste per year. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">
                In the US, the average person wasted a pound of food every day. 
                The healthier/stricter their diet, the more food waste they produced.
                Food, along with other types of biomass waste like paper, wood dust, 
                can be used in the production of bioenergy through many different ways. 
                Two common ways are through burning and the production of biogas. 
                The burning of trash and biomass waste is typically done in energy plants. 
                The burning waste is used to heat water into steam. 
                This steam in turn can turn turbines that generate electricity through 
                movement in a magnetic field. The advantages of this is that the waste 
                is reduced to a more elementary state that can be better mixed into dirt. 
                It is truly a process that eliminates two birds with one stone. 
                The drawback to this process is, however, that the burning of a vastly 
                diverse batch of waste can cause the emission of various harmful gases 
                into the atmosphere. This can have an impact on nearby neighborhoods if 
                not properly controlled. In addition, the burned product is not always 
                safe to put into the ground.

            <p style="text-indent: 40px">
                The other way to use biomass waste is by producing biogas with it. 
                This requires a anaerobic digester system that few cities have established. 
                These systems typically will be using food waste along with treated wastewater, 
                and other municipal waste to produce power or fuel. 
                The digestion process involves fermentation of the feedstock to produce biogas. 
                The mixture of biomass waste, often in the form of a ‘sludge-like’ mixture, 
                is fermented in a chamber in the absence of oxygen. 
                The product is a biogas that is about 60% methane. 
                Similar to burning biomass waste, biogas can also be burned to produce electricity. 
                Biogas production facilities can often be very efficient as they can send the biogas 
                electricity produced to the powergrid while often still having enough to power the 
                facility itself. Aside from electricity, the biogas produced can also be used as a 
                gasoline replacement when made into compressed natural gas vehicle fuel. 
                The main downside to this process are the odors produced!
