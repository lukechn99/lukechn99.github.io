	Hi collaborator (Jeffery), HTML is a markup language that tells how
	elements are formatted on a page. It is written in a tiered
	bulletpoint-esque style with a body section containing paragraphs,
	paragraphs containing lists and headers, list items being embedded
	links, etc. 
	explanation for the format: https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html
	quick cheat sheet for tools: https://htmlcheatsheet.com/
	
	Elements of HTML can either be formatted in the HTML tags
	ex. start a paragraph: <p style= "font: ariel, color: red"> "insert
	words" </p>
	Or 
	They can be formated with a CSS document to declare that ALL paragraphs
	are black, Times New Roman, etc.
	
	Advanced functionality like a slideshow or cool transition animations
	usually need JavaScript, which is an actual language.
	
	The following HTML was taken from https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryit.asp?filename=tryw3css_templates_blog&stacked=h
	as a template for what this site could look like

		  <h4><b>What is Sunday Colloquia?</b></h4>
		  <p>As we progress in university, life, and as a human species, there is a necessity for specialization. We choose to focus our learning on a specific field when we choose a major; in our careers, we are chosen to fill a specific position. Specialization is not a bad thing, since it allows each person to excel in an area of their own strengths.
			However, I believe there is much to be gained from examining a great variety of spheres of knowledge. Since primary school, we have been required to develop a core base of knowledge in required classes such as math, sciences, language, and social studies/history; supplemented with our choice of elective and extra-curricular activities. Even though I am happy with the path in which I have now come to specialize, I still feel regret for not being able to seriously study other subjects that I once enjoyed or was curious about.
			I am not sure if all of you feel the same way, but I think I have heard some of you voice similar concerns about being out of touch with subjects that you once enjoyed.
			<br>
			For this purpose, I propose to host, over the course of the next academic year, a series of colloquia, i.e. TED talks-style presentations, in which you can be the presenters. I think that, even in our group, we have a fairly wide variety of specializations and interests, so I want to create an opportunity to share something you are passionate about, of which others may know fairly little. This may be something you learn from class, or if you are doing research, or even just a hobby. This can also be a venue for small music performances, presentation of artwork, poetry, speeches, or small theatrical productions, essays, or anything really. If you have a project from a class that you want practice presenting or critique on, this can also be a good place for that.
			These gatherings could be held monthly or biweekly depending on demand and availability. I think Sunday morning from 10:00 AM to Noon could be an optimal time. I am sure I could work something out to provide food or snacks before or after the event.
			I would be much obliged if some of you would like to rotate hosting this event as well.
			<br>
			I think there can be great benefit to learning a bit about every subject at a high level. I definitely think that there are some mind-blowing things that I have learned about that would be enlightening for others to know but they will not get to learn just because of their chosen specialization. I think having a varied basis of knowledge can help with communicating ideas and interdisciplinary coordination, as well as exercising the mind and making a well-rounded individual.
			I am inspired by the salons held in the Enlightenment Era in 18th- and 19th-century Europe; namely, a social gathering for intellectual discourse. In particular, I am reminded of the story of the pianist and composer Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel (the older sister of Felix Mendelssohn) who, despite showing just as much, if not more, musical aptitude as her brother in her youth, was quite limited in her art as she aged, since music unfortunately was not considered an appropriate career for women at the time. However, she and her brother grew up in an intellectual environment because of the salon hosted by their parents, which had many famous visitors from all across Europe, and she had the opportunity to perform and premiere many of her works in a Sunday concert series in their home for such guests.
			In actuality, this is partly an excuse to hang out with you all and have fun. Despite how I am probably making it sound, this colloquia thing doesn’t have to be so serious. If during some months we are too busy to prepare presentations, we can convert this to a group study session or board game/movie time.
