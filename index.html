		<h2 style="">Background</h2>
		<p>I am a highly motivated honors student fresh out of first year college at the University of Minnesota studying computer science. 
		Through multiple tech conferences, hackathons, and self exploration, 
		I have become inspired and enamored by work in the software development field. 
		My future goal is to work on novel projects like Google’s Tensorflow (future 3.0?!) 
		and in expanding artificial intelligence to things more meaningful in the software development field than product testing 
		as it’s commonly used on now. I love to keep up with current technology developments and news, 
		and even dabble on the hardware side of things by stanning companies like AMD and their chip developments. 
		I must warn that I do not have an electrical or computer engineering degree! 
		To reach my aspirations of advanced work I am looking for opportunities in software development as an intern. 
		</p>
		<p>My interests:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Full stack software engineering - gauging from my experiences of developing web apps for hackathons and, 
			currently, a chess app for the Google Play Store, I find a certain pleasure in being with the software from beginning to end, 
			inside and out!</li>
			<li>Consulting and ERPs - during a recent career fair, I spoke with representatives from Infor, an ERP company, and Boom Lab, 
			a consulting company. My appetite for diverse learning was piqued by the vast number of companies and people they work with! 
			It was especially being exposed to what consulting across many different industries looks like that I am determined to have a 
			diversification of computer science knowledge.</li>
			<li>Novel areas and research - my initial drive for computer science came from my passion for computer science related areas 
			of math like graph theory and number theory, as well as a variety of extended research projects I embarked on. 
			I realize now that I want to develop my hard skills and understanding of the field first, and then conduct my own exploration later.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>My skills are Java, Python, Android app development with Java and XML, and web development with HTML, CSS, and JS, 
		and some associated packages and frameworks like Flask for Python, Pandas, and Tensorflow. More details on my 
		<a href="./csci.html">computer science page</a>.
